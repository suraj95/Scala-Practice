# Scala-Practice

 The name Scala is an abbreviation of the term **SCAlable LAnguage**, a fitting description of its intention. Professor Martin Odersky and his group at EPFL created the language in 2003 to provide a high-performance, concurrent-ready environment for functional programming and object-oriented programming on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) platform.

## Installing Scala

 To install Scala manually, download the Scala 2.11 distribution from http://www.scalalang.org and add its “bin” directory to your path. The distribution includes the Scala runtimes, tools, compiled libraries, and source, but the most important item we’ll need is the scala command. This command provides (among other features) the REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) shell we will use to learn and experiment with the Scala language. To install Scala automatically, use a package manager such as Homebrew for OS X, Chocolatey for Windows, or apt-get/Yum for Linux systems.
