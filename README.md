# Scala-Practice

 The name Scala is an abbreviation of the term **SCAlable LAnguage**, a fitting description of its intention. Professor Martin Odersky and his group at EPFL created the language in 2003 to provide a high-performance, concurrent-ready environment for functional programming and object-oriented programming on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) platform.
